              Knee replacement surgery is being increasingly accepted by
              patients with severe osteoarthritis for relief from pain and
              disability, thereby improving overall quality of life. Now even
              younger individuals are undergoing knee replacement. They not only
              expect relief from pain, but also want to be able to participate
              in sports and other recreational activities. Advances in
              technology, surgical methods, and effective physical
              rehabilitation have resulted in predictable and better outcomes.
              Individuals become so comfortable that they forget about their
              artificial knee.

              While acceptance for knee replacement is constantly on the rise,
              there are gaps in knowledge and apprehensions about surgery and
              rehabilitation. Patients and family members want to know about
              post-operative pain, resumption of activities of daily living,
              going back to work, driving, sports, etc. This guide is a
              beneficial resource for educating patients about the chain of
              events before, during and after surgery. This also provides a
              comprehensive information about do’s and don’ts to make them
              confident and assured when planning for knee replacement.

              the field of knee arthroplasty. It is simple, easy to understand
              and follow, and above all meets the much-needed demand for such a
